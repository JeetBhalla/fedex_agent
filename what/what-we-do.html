                  FedEx is a 50-year-old Fortune 100 company headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. It
                  provides a portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services. FedEx is widely recognized
                  for its innovation, using data from every journey to enhance tracking and visibility. It is also known
                  for its strong commitment to sustainability and community support. With a team of over 400,000
                  members, FedEx connects 99% of the world's GDP, showcasing its substantial impact on global trade and
                  logistics.

                  In its first 50 years of operation, FedEx's physical network of planes, trucks, and people created one
                  of the world's most successful companies. As FedEx looks ahead to the next 50 years, it plans to
                  leverage technology and data in innovative ways to "make supply chains smarter for everyone." To
                  achieve this vision, FedEx has partnered with Accenture to modernize its technology and operations.
               </p>
               <p>
                  The collaboration with Accenture began with strategy and consulting for a new Chief Digital and
                  Information Officer organization. It then progressed to a large Managed Services contract aimed at
                  modernizing technology delivery and is now advancing into a journey-to-cloud program. This
                  transformation focuses on the core of FedEx's business, enabling its transition from a logistics
                  company to a technology-led organization.
               </p>
               <p>The seven-year Managed Services contract with Accenture aims to enhance productivity and value
                  delivery while reducing costs and accelerating delivery timelines. Accenture is providing services
                  related to systems development, enhancement, support, and maintenance—capabilities that were
                  previously spread across multiple vendors. Approximately 7,000 people are involved in delivering this
                  initiative for FedEx, targeting a 33% cost saving.</p>
               <p>This global partnership has delivery hubs in Memphis and Amsterdam, supported by delivery centers in
                  India and the Philippines. The collaboration signifies a strategic step for FedEx as it continues to
                  evolve and redefine its role in the logistics and technology industries.
